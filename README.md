# bytewrite

**Write real bytes, not text.**

`bytewrite` is a simple command-line tool for creating **binary files** from **human-readable binary or hexadecimal input**.

When you type `00000001` into a text file, you're writing eight separate characters ('0', '0', ..., '1') â€” **not** a single byte.  
`bytewrite` lets you **speak in bits or hex** and generate **true binary output**, exactly how the machine sees it.

Perfect for:
- Learning how bytes, memory, and filesystems *really* work
- Building custom file formats
- Bootstrapping tiny virtual machines or games
- Hacking, CTFs, systems programming, retro computing
- Finally understanding the difference between *text* and *bytes*.
